"""Assemble the ``<code-mode>`` block appended to the model's system instruction.

The block is the sandbox's *inventory* — which Python, which preinstalled
packages, which importable functions. The invariant contract of calling
``execute_code`` lives in the tool's description instead, so the two never
restate each other.

The Python version and package list are reported by the sandbox itself in its
``ReadyFrame``, which only arrives once a container has booted — i.e. after the
first ``execute_code`` call. They are cached here, keyed by the backend's
``identity`` (its URL or image) rather than on ``ExecuteCodeTool``, so one warm
process serves every agent pointing at the same image and the value survives a
tool being rebuilt. Recording is monotonic and rendering is sorted: the block
must be byte-stable once known, because it sits in front of the whole prompt
and any churn re-writes the model provider's cached prefix.

Tags are indented; their text content is not. The ``<tools-package>`` body is
Python source, where leading whitespace is meaningful.
