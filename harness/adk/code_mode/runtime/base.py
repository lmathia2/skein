"""Sandbox runtime interfaces.

A runtime is responsible for:

- preparing an isolated environment with ``/tools`` and ``/workspace`` mounts
- launching ``python -m harness.adk.code_mode_sandbox`` inside it
- exposing an async ``send(frame)`` / ``recv()`` control pipe
- capturing each block's stdout/stderr as an ``OutputFrame``
- tearing the environment down when the handle is closed

A session is held open for the duration of a **turn** (one ADK invocation) and
runs one or more code blocks against a persistent process + ``/workspace``. All
public backends satisfy the same ``SandboxBackend`` protocol so the executor can
stay backend-agnostic.
